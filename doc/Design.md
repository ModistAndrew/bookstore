# Function Design
## Control System
- receive input from command line or GUI
- check whether the input is valid and whether the user has permission
- interact with value and provide output
## Account System
- maintain account information
- provide interface to log in, register, change password
- maintain current user information, including permission level
## Book System
- maintain book information
- provide interface to search, buy, stock up, enter information, modify information
## Log System
- maintain log information, including time and income/outcome
- provide interface to check log by time
# Data Design
- string[i] means a string with length at most i
- \* means unique
## Account
- *UserID: string[30]
- Password: string[30]
- Username: string[30]
- Privilege: int
## Book
- *UUID: unsigned int
- *ISBN: string[20]
- BookName: string[60]
- Author: string[60]
- Keyword: string[60]
    - multiple keywords are separated by '|'
- Stock: unsigned int
- Price: unsigned float
## Log
- *Tick: unsigned int
### Income & Outcome Log
- UUID
- Stock
- Price
### System Log
- User: string[30]
- Command: string[200]
# Interaction Design
- When failed, simply print "Invalid\n", including syntax error or permission level not enough
- [i] means the command requires permission level i
- use regex to express input format. see Data Design for parameter format
